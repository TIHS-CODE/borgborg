## What is it?
**Robots.** Borg on Borg violence. Set up your Borg's Stats and it's Program exactly as needed.  
**Automated.** All Borgs are automated, focus on learning the level and enemies to set your Borg up for success.  
**Import/Export.** Share any Borg, Program, Grid, or Level you make.  
**Coding Project.** It's all in one file and it'll only get longer. Mod it.  
**Incomplete.** Don't get too attached to your creations. Eventually updates will come where a full reset is required.
